# Picard_Marie-Eve_project

## Summary

Education:
* B.Sc. in cognitive neuroscience
* Currently a Master's student in Psychology at Université de Montréal

I am interested in the neural correlates of pain and the communication of pain. The goal of my master project is to predict the occurrence and intensity of the facial expression of pain from brain activity (fMRI data) in response to a tonic painful stimuli. 

I'm also interested in the different methods used to analyze neuroimaging data.

## Background

Facial expression of pain is an important non-verbal informative element of communication, signaling an immediate threat and a need for help. Facial movements related to the experience of pain are associated not only with the sensory dimension of pain (i.e., pain intensity) but also with its affective dimension (i.e., the unpleasantness of pain). The facial expression can be measured with the Facial Action Coding System (FACS, Ekman & Friesen, 1978), which is based on the possible action of muscles or groups of muscles, called action units. From the activity of these action units, we can compute a composite score (FACS score) taking into account the frequency and the intensity of the contraction of these action units. 

## Tools

The completion of this project will require the following tool: 
* **Python scripts** to write the code for the analysis
* Several python modules: 
   * Pandas: to manipulate the behavioral dataframe
   * Numpy: to manipulate arrays
   * Nibabel: to load the fMRI contrast images (from .hdr files to Nifti objects)
   * Scikit-learn: for machine learning stuff
   * Nilearn: to extract and to visualize the fMRI data
* The analysis will be run on **compute canada**
* The scripts will be added to the **github** repository

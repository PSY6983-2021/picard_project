# Picard_Marie-Eve_project

## Summary

Education:
* B.Sc. in cognitive neuroscience
* Currently a Master's student in Psychology at Université de Montréal

I am interested in the neural correlates of pain and the communication of pain. The goal of my master project is to predict the occurrence and intensity of the facial expression of pain from brain activity (fMRI data) in response to a tonic painful stimuli. 

I'm also interested in the different methods used to analysis neuroimaging data.
